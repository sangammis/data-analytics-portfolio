# Credit Risk Analytics — Loan Default Prediction

## Business Problem
Financial institutions face significant losses due to loan defaults.  
The objective of this project is to **analyze customer data**, identify **high-risk segments**, and 
**predict loan default probability** to support better loan approval decisions.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **MySQL** — Data extraction & segmentation analysis  
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** — EDA & feature engineering  
- **Machine Learning** — Logistic Regression, XGBoost  
- **Power BI** — Risk monitoring dashboard  
- **GitHub** — Version control & portfolio hosting  


## Key Metrics Analyzed
- Default Rate
- Income Segmentation
- Credit Score Bands
- Employment Type Risk
- Loan Amount vs Default


## Key Insights

### High-Risk Segments
- **Low income customers** show higher default probability  
- **Credit score < 600** strongly correlates with default  
- **Contract employees** are riskier than salaried employees  

##  Power BI Dashboard Highlights
- Total Customers & Default Rate KPIs  
- Default Rate by Employment Type  
- Income & Credit Score Risk Segmentation  
- Interactive slicers for deeper analysis  


## Business Recommendations
- Tighten approval rules for customers with **credit score < 600**
- Apply stricter checks for **contract-based employment**
- Offer better loan terms to **low-risk customers**
